### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2023

+ Projec title: How do Happy Moments Vary Across Different Demographics?
+ This project is conducted by Haixin Shu

+ Project summary: In my exploration of happiness using the "HappyDB" dataset, I aimed to uncover the nuanced nature of happiness across diverse demographic groups. By integrating "cleaned_hm.csv" and "demographic.csv" through a shared identifier, I categorized happiness reasons based on attributes like age, country of origin, gender, marital status, and parenthood. My analytical journey encompassed sentiment analysis, clustering, and topic modeling, with sentiment levels showing similarities while topic modeling unveiled significant variations in the contributors to happiness among demographics. For comprehensive details and code, please refer to the project documentation and analysis notebooks.
